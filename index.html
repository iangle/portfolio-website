                Hello, my name is Isaac Angle, I am a Software Developer with my Masters in Computer Science at Eastern Washington University (EWU).
                I obtained my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Whitworth University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became interested in Software Developement when I was a teenager. My mother bought me some learn to code software.
                The learning software I remember most fondly was one where I was taught to move a turtle around the screen and draw lines.
                I remember being fascinated by the things I could do with a computer, I wanted to learn how to create more complex things with software, so I pursued an education in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at school, I worked mostly in the IT industry. I prefer to build software, but I believe learning how to implement software for the end user is key to creating good software.
                While working with completed software, I gained an appreciation for software that is easy to use, well maintained, and created with the end user in mind.
                I worked with many different kinds of software which were "made by engineers", meaning the end user was not taken into account, only the logic behind the program.
                I believe that software should be made with a purpose and a group of people in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my off days, I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee, Volleyball, board games, video games, and building computers. I am the leader of an Ultimate Frisbee group located at the Idaho State line, and we play once a week.
                I enjoy trying new board/video games with friends and brainstorming ideas for interesting projects.
